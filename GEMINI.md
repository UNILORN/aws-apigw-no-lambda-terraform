# GEMINI.md - Project Context for AI Agent

This file provides essential context for an AI agent interacting with this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying AWS infrastructure, specifically:
- **AWS API Gateway**: Configured to integrate directly with other AWS services, demonstrating a "no-Lambda" approach.
- **AWS Step Functions**: State machine definitions are provided in the `stepfunctions/` directory.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: Used as a backend for data storage.
- **AWS IAM**: Roles and policies necessary for the services to interact.

The primary goal is to showcase an API Gateway setup that orchestrates workflows via Step Functions without relying on AWS Lambda for business logic.

## Key Technologies and Tools

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing AWS resources.
- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services (API Gateway, Step Functions, DynamoDB, IAM).
- **JSON**: Used for defining AWS Step Functions state machines.

## Repository Structure

- `apigateway.tf`: API Gateway resource definitions.
- `dynamodb.tf`: DynamoDB table definitions.
- `iam.tf`: IAM roles and policies.
- `main.tf`: Main Terraform entry point.
- `stepfunctions.tf`: Step Functions state machine definitions.
- `variables.tf`: Input variables for Terraform configurations.
- `stepfunctions/`: Directory containing JSON definitions for Step Functions state machines.
    - `create-item-statemachine.json`
    - `get-item-statemachine.json`
- `README.md`: General project information and setup instructions.

## Common Tasks and Workflows

As an AI agent, you might be asked to assist with the following:

1.  **Infrastructure Deployment/Management**:
    *   Running `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`.
    *   Modifying existing AWS resource configurations (e.g., API Gateway routes, DynamoDB table attributes, Step Function definitions).
    *   Adding new AWS resources.
2.  **Step Functions State Machine Updates**:
    *   Editing the JSON definitions within the `stepfunctions/` directory.
    *   Ensuring the Terraform configuration (`stepfunctions.tf`) correctly references and deploys updated state machine definitions.
3.  **Troubleshooting**:
    *   Debugging Terraform deployment issues.
    *   Analyzing AWS service configurations.

## Development Environment Setup

To work with this project, ensure you have:
-   Terraform CLI installed.
-   AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.

Typical Terraform commands:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

## Testing

Currently, there are no dedicated unit or integration tests beyond `terraform plan` for validating the infrastructure configuration. Verification typically involves:
-   Reviewing `terraform plan` output.
-   Manually testing the deployed API Gateway endpoints.
-   Monitoring Step Functions executions in the AWS console.

## Conventions

-   Terraform HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for infrastructure definitions.
-   Standard JSON for Step Functions state machine definitions.
-   AWS resource naming conventions should follow existing patterns.
